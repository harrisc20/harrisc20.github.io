            <td>This article explains how algorithms influence what content individuals encounter online, shaping opinions, beliefs, and behaviors. By filtering information based on user behavior, algorithms create personalized experiences but also reinforce existing biases. The piece emphasizes that while these systems improve convenience, they can unintentionally limit exposure to diverse viewpoints, contributing to echo chambers and filter bubbles.</td>

            <td>This article discusses how social media platforms use algorithms to prioritize certain content over others, often based on engagement metrics. It highlights how these algorithms can manipulate what users see, spreading sensationalized or misleading content more widely. The piece also raises concerns about the societal consequences of algorithm-driven information curation, including polarization and reduced access to balanced information.</td>
